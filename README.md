# C++ algorithms

This project consisits of some algorithms in C++.

## Getting Started

It's not such project, as you can use in real-world projects. It's just an example of implementation of some algorithms.  
But if you wish you can test these algorithms by following this steps:
1. Clone the repository or download archive 
```
git clone https://github.com/sanchouz12/CPP-algorithms
```
2. Inside of each folder you'll find a Visual Studio .sln files. Open them to test the algorithms.

### Prerequisites

If you want to test the algorithms, you'll need to install Visual Studio 2019.

## Built With

* Visual Studio 2019 and C++.
