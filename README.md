# C++ algorithms

This project consisits of some algorithms in C++.

## Algorithms

### Search algorithms

1. Binary search
2. Breadth-first search (unfinished)

### Sort algorithms

1. Bubble sort
2. Insertion sort
3. Choose sort
4. Shell sort
5. Quick sort

## Getting Started

To get a copy of this algorithms do the following:
1. Clone the repository or download archive
```
git clone https://github.com/sanchouz12/CPP-algorithms
```
2. Inside of each folder you'll find a Visual Studio .sln files. Open them to test the algorithms.

### Prerequisites

If you want to test or modify the algorithms, you'll need to install Visual Studio.
